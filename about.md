My name is Sven Hofstede and I'm currently working as a Business Intelligence Consultant in Belgium. I love exploring data and finding stories and insights within datasets. I believe decisions should be based on data and progress must be measurable. 

<!-- TODO: add some additional information about previous project -->

I like playing soccer. Always looking for new experiences. I also don't mind reading a good book.
