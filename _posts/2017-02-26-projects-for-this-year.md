These are my intended side-project goals for this year. Obviously some of them will be very limited in scope and won't be anything special. It's all about getting a feel for how this stuff works instead of building production ready products. I also plan to document the progress for each of these projects by livestreaming on Youtube.

**Some type of esports data, need to find something first**

## Web scraping & data processing
